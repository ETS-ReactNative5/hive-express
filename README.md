### Short Answer Questions

1. What are the most important aspects of quality software?
First of all, we can define quality software (from now on, QS) as “reasonably bug or defect free, delivered on time and within budget, meets requirements and/or expectations, and is maintainable”, according to [Try QA](http://tryqa.com/).

We can break definition of QS depending on which one of the three involved stakeholders we take into account: development team, sponsors or end users. Therefore, we can identify three aspects of QS, which will be explained in the following paragraphs.

On one hand, we get the functional quality. As [David Chappell](http://www.davidchappell.com/writing/white_papers/The_Three_Aspects_of_Software_Quality_v1.0-Chappell.pdf) says, it can relate to:

* Meeting the specified requirements.
* Creating software that has few defects.
* Good enough performance.
* Ease of learning and ease of use.

Another aspect of QS is structural quality. It refers to the way the code is structured, and the properties of this kind of quality are: 

* Code testability (easy-to-test code).
* Code maintainability (easy-to-change-without-introducing-bugs code).
* Code understandability and code efficiency (readable code, DRY).
* Code security.

Some of the points given supra are linked to the SQ Attributes Approach (QSAA). It has to do with fixed quality models. An old one, which seems to take into account the first two aspects discussed, would be the ISO 8402-1986 standard, which defined quality as “the totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bears its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs” and highlighted the following attributes: good design, good functionality, reliability, consistency, durability, good after sales service, and value for money”.

One more modern standard would be ISO/IEC 25010:2011, which described a hierarchy of eight quality characteristics, each composed of sub-characteristics: functional suitability, reliability, operability, performance efficiency, security, compatibility, maintainability, transferability. Moreover, it defines a quality-in-use model composed of five characteristics: effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, safety, and usability.

Another approach would be the Defect Management one (SQDM), defined by ([ASQ](https://asq.org/quality-resources/software-quality) as the one “based on counting and managing defects. Defects are commonly categorized by severity, and the numbers in each category are used for planning”. As ASQ continues, “[m]ore mature software development organizations use tools, such as defect leakage matrices (for counting the numbers of defects that pass through development phases prior to detection) and control charts, to measure and improve development process capability” .

That is how we end at the third and last QS aspect, the development process quality, which affects the value received by the three of the stakeholders mentioned above. The key parts of process quality are:

* meeting delivery dates.
* meeting budgets.
* a repeatable development process that reliably delivers quality software.

2. What libraries are being used in the app and why?

3. A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?

The knowledge and skills required for a project depend on the deliveries that must be made. In this case, we are questioned about a website. Therefore, the former will have to do with full stack web development.

This requires both back-end and front-end capabilities. The former refer to the “server-side” of web applications. The latter, to the client-side.

The back-end developer create the logic to make the web app work properly. They focus on databases, scripting, and the architecture of websites, and their code helps to communicate the database information to the browser. They work, mainly, with:

* Server-side programming language/s (Python, Ruby,...).
* Database Management System technology (MongoDB, MySQL, …).
* Server.
* API (REST and SOAP).

The front-end developer is in charge of the experience of the end user, which means they have to carry on the following tasks:

* Apply the design to the web using web technologies like DOM, HTML, CSS and Js.
* Change and maintain the web.
* Adapt the design to various devices and browsers.
* Improve the interaction between the user and the web.
* Use APIs to connect the web with various services or systems.


Both of them should feel comfortable with git and version control systems, problem solving, and testing. 

The full-stack developer is the one with all the skills discussed in the previous paragraphs.
