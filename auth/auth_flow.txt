        // Then ask them to 'complete their profile' with other information that is not on meetup
        // probably user meetup id
        // if meetup id is not in user table, make a new account.
        // if it is, log them in
        
        //When user logs in, create a new session with access and refresh tokens
        //the hive is the source of truth for attendance etc
        //Maybe have colour coding for descrepencies between meetup and the hive
        //login and signup are the same button - just different comparisons

        Auth strategies...

        Make a local strategy for pure admin accounts, 
        have an array of accepted admin emails

        if you login with one of these ,mark them as admin:true in the database
        stretch: have an admin user that can add to this list .. have an admins schema that holds the email addresses
